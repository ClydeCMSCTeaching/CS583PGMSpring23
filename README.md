## Official Course Description

This course will cover probabilistic graphical models -- powerful and interpretable models for reasoning under uncertainty, The generic families of models such as directed, undirected, and factor graphs as well as specific representations such as hidden Markov models and conditional random fields will be discussed. The discussions will include both the theoretical aspects of representation, learning, and inference, and their applications in many interesting fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, computational biology, and medical diagnosis. For Spring 2023, this course will have a speical focus on causality and PGM's intersection with modern AI-systems although all basic topics in PGMs

**Important note:** In previous years, this course has focused primiarly on the foundations of probabilistic graphical models (PGM). For Spring 2023, the course's lectures will focus primarily on foundations and concepts; however, the assignments will be half programming assignments in Python. Almost all of the lecture time will be used for discussing and using probability theory, statistics, optimization, and calculus for understanding, analysis, and derivation of PGM approaches and algorithms. 

## Prerequisites
Strong background in calculus, statistics, and probability. Expirience with data science projects in Python recomended. 

## Textbook
[Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models) By Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman
We also use [Causality](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/) by Pearl quite frequently although Koller and Friedman will be the primary text.

Other great texts to skin through for particuarly challenging topics: 
- Modeling and Reasoning with Bayesian networks by Adnan Darwiche.
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Chris Bishop.
- Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy.
- Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David J. C. Mackay. Available online.
- Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by David Barber. Available online.
- Graphical models, exponential families, and variational inference by Martin J. Wainwright and Michael I. Jordan. Available online
- And also never forget YouTube is a great source of free lecture material.

## Grading

Item | Points
--- | ---
Assignments | 30%
Midterm | 30%
Final | 40%
Total | 100

### Assignments

There will be approximately 7 assignments. Assignments will focus on the theory and foundations of probabilistic graphical models as well as programming. Each assignment will have both a theory and programming question in Python.

#### Late Submission Policy
Late work is not accepted. This policy is strictly enforced. 

#### Extensions

I do not extend deadlines, please do not ask.

#### Extra Credit

I do not assign extra-credit work. Why? For at least two reasons:

1. Extra credit is rarely truly optional; every student feels they have to do it, and hence it becomes a required credit in practice.
2. The TAs are often overworked and underpaid.

## Code of Academic Honesty

I take the Code of Academic Honesty very seriosly and I report violations to the university. Please read the Code of Academic Honesty in the student handbook: https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty.

## Center for Disability Resources

Reasonable accommodations (https://web.iit.edu/cdr/services/reasonable-accommodations) are available to the students with documented disabilities. Students must first obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources: https://web.iit.edu/cdr/.
